# TTA-Project
This repository servers to contain our progress documentation towards completing our project for TTA along with additional files. 

This documentation includes the weekly updated daily standup detailing the current goals, blocks, and deliverables for each sprint/week.

Within the daily standup there are links to additional documents containing in-depth research and ideas.

These documents are also present within the repository to faciliate navigation. These files are also updated weekly if any changes were made.

# Branches 

Currently we have created a branch to contain the work done for the identified audio bug.

Once we have completed addressing a bug, this branch will be merged to the master branch.
